# Web Frontend Decision

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement
Choose a tool for the frontend website

## Considered Options
Wordpress or React

## Decision Outcome
Use React

Wordpress is easier to use for people unfamiliar with coding, it could be more easily transferred to someone else to maintain, and the business owner could make some updates herself, but it will still require learning the Wordpress environment and it will not teach me the DevOps and coding skills I want to learn.

React creates stunning and modern websites, it is the primary tool currently used by website developers, it will help me learn JavaScript code, I will learn VS Code to write the React app, I will practice Git, I will learn how to deploy and monitor it in a cloud platform.
