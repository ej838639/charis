# Cloud Hosting Decision

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement
Determine cloud provider to use for hosting the react app

## Considered Options
AWS, GCP, Bluehost

## Decision Outcome
Use GCP with domain on Bluehost

Want to improve DevOps skills and learn how to use one of the primary cloud providers. I already have Project Lazarus using AWS, so I want to learn Google Gloud Platform (GCP). I registered the domain with Bluehost since I originally was planning to use Wordpress, but I switched to React to learn React and JavaScript better, and hosting React on Bluehost is complicated by their focus on Wordpress, and will not help me learn a cloud provider. 

It seems the domain registration for charismediation.org cannot be refunded from Bluehost, so I will keep it there for now.
